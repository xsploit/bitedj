class Track;

/// Portable, per-filesystem store for the cues a DJ sets on this unit.
///
/// Hot cues and memory cues edited while a track plays are written back to the
/// drive the track came from, into a self-contained SQLite database next to the
/// analysis cache: `<mountRoot>/.bitedj/cues.sqlite`. Entries are keyed by the
/// track's path relative to the mount root and hold positions in seconds, so
/// the cues travel with the stick and reload on any other Bite DJ unit.
///
/// A stored entry is an *override*: it is the whole picture of a track's hot
/// cue bank, memory cue bank, Engine-identified cue controls and main cue, and it is applied after the
/// rekordbox ANLZ import, so it wins over whatever rekordbox exported. An entry
/// with no cues in it is meaningful — that is a track whose cues the DJ deleted
/// — which is why the store distinguishes "no entry" from "an empty entry".
///
/// Unlike FsAnalysisCache this store does not keep its connections open: every
/// operation opens the database, runs one statement and closes it again. The
/// writes are a few hundred bytes each and rare (only when the cues actually
/// changed), while a lingering file descriptor on a USB stick makes `umount`
/// fail with EBUSY on eject — the eject path closes the analysis caches *before*
/// pumping the event loop that evicts (and thereby saves) the track, so a store
/// that held connections could be reopened behind the eject's back.
///
/// All members are static: the baselines below are process-wide state guarded
/// by an internal mutex, and every entry point is safe to call from any thread.
